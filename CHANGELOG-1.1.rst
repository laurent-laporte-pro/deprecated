and this project adheres to `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_.

v1.1.5 (2019-02-28)
===================

Bug fix release

Fix
---

- Fix #6: Use :func:`inspect.isroutine` to check if the wrapped object is a user-defined or built-in function or method.

Other
-----

- Upgrade Tox configuration to add support for Python 3.7.
  Also, fix PyTest version for Python 2.7 and 3.4 (limited support).
  Remove dependency 'requests[security]': useless to build documentation.

- Upgrade project configuration (``setup.py``) to add support for Python 3.7.


v1.1.4 (2018-11-03)
===================

Bug fix release

Fix
---

- Fix #4: Correct the function :func:`~deprecated.deprecated`:
  Don't pass arguments to :meth:`object.__new__` (other than *cls*).

Other
-----

- Change the configuration for TravisCI and AppVeyor:
  drop configuration for Python **2.6** and **3.3**.
  add configuration for Python **3.7**.

  .. note::

     Deprecated is no more tested with Python **2.6** and **3.3**.
     Those Python versions are EOL for some time now and incur incompatibilities
     with Continuous Integration tools like TravisCI and AppVeyor.
     However, this library should still work perfectly...


v1.1.3 (2018-09-03)
===================

Bug fix release

Fix
---

- Fix #2: a deprecated class is a class (not a function). Any subclass of a deprecated class is also deprecated.


v1.1.2 (2018-08-27)
===================

Bug fix release

Fix
---

- Add a ``MANIFEST.in`` file to package additional files like "LICENSE.rst" in the source distribution.


v1.1.1 (2018-04-02)
===================

Bug fix release

Fix
---

- Minor correction in ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` for Sphinx builds: add the ``-d`` option to put apart the ``doctrees``
  from the generated documentation and avoid warnings with epub generator.
- Fix in documentation configuration: remove hyphens in ``epub_identifier`` (ISBN number has no hyphens).
- Fix in Tox configuration: set the versions interval of each dependency.

Other
-----

- Change in documentation: improve sentence phrasing in the Tutorial.
- Restore the epub title to "Python Deprecated Library v1.1 Documentation" (required for Lulu.com).


v1.1.0 (2017-11-06)
===================

- Add missing ``__doc__`` and ``__version__`` attributes to :mod:`deprecated` module.
