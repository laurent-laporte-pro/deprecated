Welcome to Deprecated’s Documentation.
This documentation is divided into different parts.
I recommend that you get started with :ref:`installation` and then head over to the :ref:`tutorial`.
If you'd rather dive into the internals of the Deprecated Library, check out the :ref:`api` documentation.


User's Guide

This part of the documentation, which is mostly prose, begins with some
